## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This proposal outlines the development of a weather forecast mobile application to provide users with real-time weather data, forecasts, and alerts, enhancing decision-making for daily activities, travel, and safety.

### 1.2 Objectives

* Deliver real-time and forecasted weather data for user-selected locations.
* Provide an intuitive, accessible, and customizable user interface.
* Incorporate advanced features like widgets and notifications.

### 1.3 Target Audience

* **General Public:** Users seeking daily weather updates for planning.
* **Commuters and Travellers:** Individuals needing location-specific forecasts.
* **Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Hikers, cyclists, and others requiring detailed weather insights.
* **Businesses:** Organisations relying on weather data for operations (e.g., agriculture, logistics).

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1 Core Features

* **Current Weather:** Display temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation probability, and atmospheric pressure with dynamic icons.
* **Location Management:** Auto-detect user location via GPS, support manual searches by city, and allow saving up to 10 favourite locations.
* **Forecasts:** Provide 24-48 hour hourly forecasts and 7-14 day daily forecasts, including sunrise/sunset times.
* **Weather Alerts:** Show government-issued severe weather warnings with push notifications for critical events.
* **Customisation:** Allow users to select temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit), wind speed units, and time formats.

### 2.2 Additional Features

* **Widgets:** Home screen widgets (4x1, 4x2) displaying current weather and forecasts.
* **Sharing:** Share weather data or forecasts via social media (Twitter, Threads, Facebook).
* **Offline Access:** Cache weather data for up to 24 hours for offline use.

### 2.3 Out of Scope

* Real-time radar animations (unless the API supports without additional cost).
* Integration with smart home devices or voice assistants (future phase).
* Multi-language support (initially English only).

## 3. Future Opportunities

* **AI Integrations:** Integrate an LLM-powered helper for activity suggestion, for example, providing the future plan + weather forecast to llm, than return suggestion to user.
